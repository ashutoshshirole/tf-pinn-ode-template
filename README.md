# tf-pinn-ode-template
Built a lightweight Scientific ML solver that learns solutions to nonlinear ODEs using Physics-Informed Neural Networks in TensorFlow. The model enforces dynamics via autodiff residuals at collocation points and is benchmarked against an implicit trapezoidal reference solver with error and convergence analysis.
